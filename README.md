# Chill Chatbot

## Introduction

This small chatbot allows users to have conversations about anything with the bot. The user is also able 
to ask about the weather for any given city, and will also (...in the future) be able to ask for currency exchange, 
movie times & reviews, and many other features I hope to implement. 


## Installation

To be able to use the bot go ahead and visit him (...or her??) [here](https://chill-chatbot.herokuapp.com/). If you
want to do any sort of contribution please download Python 3.5+, which you can 
download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

After installing Python clone or download this repo. After doing so run the following command to 
install all the requirements:
```python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
When all the packages are done downloading you can start up the app by running:
```python3
python3 app.py
```
Running that command will start up a local server and you can navigate to [localhost:5000](#)
Go ahead and chat with the bot, if you are not sure what it can do just type "help". Enjoy!
